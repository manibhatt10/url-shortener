 What You Must Know by the end of Day 2
By now, you should understand the "Big Three" files that handle every request on your site:

1. The Model (models.py) - The "Data"
Concept: This is your database blueprint.

Your Code: You used a class to define that every link needs an original_url and a short_code.

Takeaway: If you want to change what information you store (like adding a "user" field), you do it here.

2. The View (views.py) - The "Brain"
Concept: This is where the logic happens.

Your Code: You wrote two functions:

index: Handles showing the form and saving new links.

redirect_url: Handles looking up a code, adding a +1 to clicks, and sending the user away.

Takeaway: This is where you write "If X happens, do Y."

3. The Template (index.html) - The "Face"
Concept: This is the HTML the user sees.

Your Code: You used Django Template Language (the {% %} and {{ }} tags) to display a list of items from your database.

Takeaway: This is where you decide how the data should look to a human.
